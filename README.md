# weather-dashboard

In this homework assignment, we used and API from openweathermap.org, as well as time from Moment.js to create a weather dashboard.

We used local storage, multi Ajax and for loops to call a city and display information in two places.

Though I know it's not perfect, I am most proud of my progress on this assignment and actually understand all of the inner workings on my page!
